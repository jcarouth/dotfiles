# jcarouth has dotfiles

Dotfiles are a way to personalize an environment. For me this repo contains the
configurations I use to customize my Mac development environments.

## Install

Run this:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/jcarouth/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
install.sh
```

This script will initialize this repository and symlink appropriate files into
your home directory. All customization should happen within the ~/.dotfiles
directory.
